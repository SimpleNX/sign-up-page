# sign-up-page

## What the page is about
The page is a basic sign-up page, which has some background images and texts to go with it.

## What have I learnt and implemented
I learnt css functions, pseudo elements for forms, different ways to specify sizes and how to make 
a element a little responsive with them.
I also learnt HTML forms, and validation in the html itself and using css to style them according to 
different cases.
